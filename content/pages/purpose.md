headline: But why?
Summary: a short back-story

Not too long ago, depending on when I wrote this, I decided to learn to code. I found a fantastic website called 'freeCodeCamp.org' and proceeded to blast through the exercises and modules until about halfway through the back end development certification part. By now I had done tons of javascript algorithm exercises and created a bunch of projects (hosted on
<a href="https://codepen.io/chrisdinant/" style="text-decoration: none;" target="_blank">https://codepen.io/chrisdinant/</a>) and a few small websites.<br />

<br />
<br />
By now my scientific research had moved more into high-throughput automated microscopy techniques which create large amounts of data, meaning that I would have a use for ML tools at work.<br />
<br />
So I stopped my web development training and focused on learning R and Python. Over the last year or so I have become a data science addict. I read everything I can find on anything related to data science. I take online courses on data science topics. I do Kaggle challenges. I train models on my microscopy data.<br />
<br />
I have always known that my real passion was not science itself, or music or something else.<br />
<br />
My passion is learning.<br />
<br />
And I have come to the conclusion that for someone who loves analyzing data and learning new things all the time, DataScience&#8482; is the ultimate profession.<br />
<br />
That's why I have set my mind on becoming a data scientist.<br />
<br />
On this blog I will post some of the things that I learn or have learned on the way to hopefully be of use to other people who are just starting to study DataScience.<br />
<br />

<i> Update 2020: I decided to talk about more than just data science on this blog now. Currently I have expanded my interests with the study of consciousness and free will so you should see a couple of posts on these topics float by as well.</i>
